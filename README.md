Fossil Fuel Use at COA
================
by Data Betas

## Summary

Our project looked at the usage of fossil fuels by COA owned buildings. We used data that recorded 
the type of fuel used, the building it was used in, and the gallons used, among other things. We
looked into the amount of fuel used for each college owned building, the efficiency of those buildings,
and the average fuel usage per month split by fuel type. Fuel usage was measured in gallons, with some 
graphs focusing on fuel usage in 2023 alone, while others looked into the fuel usage from 2014 to 2023.
Efficient use of fuel was determined by comparing the square footage of a building with the amount of
fuel that it used. We also chose to exclude two of the fuel types, dyed kerosene and coastal biodiesel,
when comparing fuel usage per fuel type since they are no longer used and were only used in a small
number of buildings while they were in use.

We found that the buildings with the highest fuel consumption were Arts & Sciences + Gates, Kaebler, 
and Blair Tyson. We also found that the Arts & Sciences building used much more fuel than even the other 
top fuel consumers. Despite this, we found that it was fairly average in terms of efficient fuel usage.
B&G was the least efficient in terms of fuel usage, but was only tenth in total fuel usage. Davis Center
and the Dorr Natural History Museum were also some of the most fuel inefficient buildings. Both of these
buildings were also some of the top fuel consumers.

When looking at average fuel use per month we found that the winter and early spring months used the most fuel,
with January being the month in which the most fuel was used. June and August had the least fuel usage of
the year. This was consistent across both heating oil and propane. We also highlighted the fuel usage for 
December. This was done because even though it is a winter month, it is also the month that most people are
not on campus. Due to this we had expected that there would be less fuel usage in December than we ended up
seeing, since there would be less need to heat all buildings as they were not being used for classes. However,
we found that December was in the top five months in terms of fuel consumption.

We also looked at the amount of fuel used by the top three fuel consumers from 2014 to 2023. These amounts were
compared to the average amount of fuel used by a well insulated family home. We found that all three buildings
used a much larger amount of fuel that the family home. This is most likely in part due to the difference in 
square footage of the buildings being compared, but there is still a very large difference. Two of the buildings,
Kaebler and Blair Tyson, had heating pumps installed. After the instilation of the heating pump in Blair Tyson there
was a decrease in fuel usage, but the same was not seen after the instilation of the heating pump in Kaebler. The
heating pump in Kaebler not really having an effect on fuel usage is probably due to the fact that it is used mostly
for air conditioning in the summer and only heat a few rooms rather than the whole building. The fuel usage for all 
three buldings also decreased in 2020, likely due to COVID causing less people to be on campus. The amount of fuel
used in these buildings has still not increased to its previous levels, though our data only shows up until 2023.
